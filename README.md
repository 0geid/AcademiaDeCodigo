# AcademiaDeCodigo

This is a little repo containing some projects done ate Academia de Código. 

Brick destroyer:
This was our first group project at Academia de Código. It's a reproduction of two gaming classics (arkanoid and pong), made with Java and a very simple gfx lib (called Simple Graphics).

Chat TCP:
This is a very simple chat app made with Java, using TCP protocol. It's a low level implementation, dealing with sockets, streams, etc.

Map Editor:
It's a very simple paint-like app made with Java, where we have a fixed-size grid and we use a keyboard cursor to paint and erase cells.

ResistLive:
This was our final project, made in the 48hr remote hackathon. It's a paid online show streaming platoform. The most challenging feature was the streaming itself, that we unfortunatelly could not finish. The app is structured with MVC architecture, using Spring, Maven, Tomcat, Java, HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf.
